# README

This is a contact list web application written in Ruby, using Ruby on Rails as the framework, and using Bootstrap to make it less hideous. 

It allows users to create an account, log in, and add friends/acquantinces to their own personal contact list. They can also edit their contacts, delete them, or delete their account entirely. 

Measures have been taken to ensure users cannot see, edit, or delete from other user's contact lists.
